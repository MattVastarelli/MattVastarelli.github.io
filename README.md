### About 

This site came about when I decided to test what I had learned very early on in my web development studies. 
The task chosen was to turn a boring website into an interesting one using CSS styling and JavaScript events. 
I was most proud of my click event fade interactions between content sections. In retrospect, I would have 
isolated my styles in their own stylesheet.
